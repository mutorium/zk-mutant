# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is in early development. Only the `main` branch is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, contact the maintainer privately (e.g., via GitHub profile contact). Include:

- a clear description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- any proof-of-concept details (as safe as possible)

You’ll receive an acknowledgement and we’ll coordinate a fix/release plan.
